        <p id="what-we-do">
            Your support helps us make a difference. Here at Totally Real Charity, we steal your money and use it for our own personal gain.
            We are a all profit organization that claims to help those in need, but in reality, we just pocket the donations.
            We have no intention of helping anyone, and we are proud of it. Thank you for your generous contributions, which we will use to fund our lavish lifestyles.
            We appreciate your trust in us, and we promise to continue our work of deceiving the public.
            Remember, every dollar you donate goes directly into our pockets, so keep the donations coming!
